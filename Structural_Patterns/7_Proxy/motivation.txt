Proxy : An interface for accessing a particular resource 

It is like providing an interface to the client that is almost identical with additional properties of the original implementation 

Proxy : A class that functions as an interface to a particular resource. That resource may be remote expensive to construct or may require logging or some other additional added functionality 


Proxy and decorator might look very similar but :
- proxy provides an identical interface ; decorator provides enhanced interface 
- Decorator typically agregates what it is decorating ; proxy doesn't have to 
- Proxy might not even be working with a materialized object 

Recap : 
A proxy has the same interface as the underlying object 
To Create a proxy , simple and replicate the existing interface of an object 
Add relevant functionality to the redifined member functions 

Different proxies have completely different behaviours
