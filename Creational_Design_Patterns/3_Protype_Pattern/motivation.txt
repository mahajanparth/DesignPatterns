It is Easier To Copy an existing object to fully initialize a new one.
In LayMans Terms : Its better to build an object from a complex blueprint rather than starting from scratch !!!


1) Complecated objects aren't designed from scratch
2) An existing( partially or fully constructed ) design is a Protype 
3) We make a copy/ clone the Protype and customize it ( Requires deep copy support)
4) We make cloning convenient 

After Review Notes :
- TO implement a Protype partially construct an object and store it somewhere
- Clone the Protype
    -implement your own deep copy functionality 
    - serialize and deserialize   ( Very useful as it traverse the whole object graph )
    - Customize the resulting instance
