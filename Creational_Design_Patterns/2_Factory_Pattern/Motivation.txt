Factory : A component responentible solely for the wholesale( not piecewise ) creation of object of differnt variations

When to use Factory Design Pattern : 

When the object creation creation is too convoluted. 
In laymans term Meaning multiple variations of the objects are possible 
What it overcomes:

-- Construtor is not descriptive 
- Name mandated by name of containing type 
- Cannot overload with same sets of arguments with different names
- Can turn into optional parameter Hell

Object Creation( Non -Piece wise , unlike builder ) can be outsourced to 

- A seperate function ( Factory Method )
- That may exist in seperate Classes
- Can create hierarchy of factories with Abstract factory
