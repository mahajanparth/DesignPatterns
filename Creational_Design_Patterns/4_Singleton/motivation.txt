Singleton : A component which is instantiated only once 

For some components it is only makes sense to have one in the system 
- Database repository 
- Object factory 

Where Singleton can be used :-
Object Creation is very expensive and time taking 
- We only do it once
-We provide everyone with the same instance

We want to prevent anyone creating additional copies

Need to take care of lazy initialization and tread safety
